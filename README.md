# Experimenting around Functorial pattern in Rust

This repository aims at exploring the followings in Rust:

- Affine Data/Control Functor hierarchy
- Multiplicative Functor hierarchy
- A port of [`QualifiedDo`](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/qualified_do.html) in Haskell to Rust macro to use the above uniformly
  + We are planning to support [`ApplicativeDo`](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/applicative_do.html#extension-ApplicativeDo) as well.
